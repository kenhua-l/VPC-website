This is a simple website to showcase NUSSU VPC

## Design concept
I am using fixed positioned pictures as backdrop to create a sort of parallax
effect when scrolling.

The dividers are placed on the bottom of each picture to give a caption vibe
to each picture.

In the dividers, are the information content I aim to relay.

## File structure
This project is simply rendering index.html and getting the relevant information
from bootstrap css, custom css and the images I provided.

## Social media and Email
VPC reaches out to its audience through [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/nussuvpc/) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nussuvpc/).

Any requests should be made to [vpc@nussu.org.sg](mailto:vpc@nussu.org.sg).
